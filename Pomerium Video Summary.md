# This is a Brief Summary of the YouTube Video _The Roman Pomerium_ by [Historia Civilis](https://www.youtube.com/@HistoriaCivilis)
## Introduction
* According to legend, Rome was founded by two brothers, Romulus and Remus
* They led an expiditon to found a new city on the banks of the Tiber river.
* After they arrived, the brothers disagreed on where they should start construction.
* Romulus was primarily focused on the military defense of the city, and therefore favored a centrally located hill known as the Palatine.
* Remus was thinking more about trade and commerce and so he favored a hill located next to the river known as the Aventine
  * This disagreement escalated into a conflict, leading to Romulus killing Remus in a moment of rage.
  * This act solified Romulus's position as the **sole ruler** of Rome.
## Establishment of the Pomerium
* After founding the city of Rome, Romulus established the pomerium, a sacred boundary that demarcated the city limits of Rome.
* The pomerium was not only a physical border, but was also seen as a spiritual protective barrier for the city and its inhabitants
## Significance of the Pomerium
* The pomerium played a crucial role in Roman society and governance
  * Certain religous rites could only be performed inside the pomerium
  * The area beyond the pomerium was considered outside the city's jurisdiction
    * This turned the area outside of Rome's original boundaries into a zone for military activity.
* Over time, as Rome expanded, the pomerium was extended to incorporate new territory
* Within the pomerium, specifc laws applied:
  * For example, the presence of weapons or armed men inside of the pomerium was prohibited and punishable by death.   
* The Romans took the pomerium very seriously, which reflects their culture of civic duty and order
